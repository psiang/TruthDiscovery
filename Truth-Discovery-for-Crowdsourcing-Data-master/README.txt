Algorithms for Estimating Truths and Worker Reliability for Crowdsourcing Data


It is aim at aggregating the crowdsourced data for getting estimated labels and worker reliabilities. This project is implmeneted using python. Accuracy and F measure are selected to compare the performance of different methodologies. The methods include: Average Voting, Majority Voting, Extension of David and Skene model, GLAD model, and Optimization based Truth Discovery algorthim - weighted voting model.

The folders included are:

Algorithms: This is the folder which has all the different models for inferring the estimated labels and worker reliabilities.

Data: It contains the dataset, which is public available AdultContent2 data, used to test the performance of the datasets. 

Experimentation: Pythons file to experiment with the data and algorithms. It contains the code for building graph to represent the relationships between items and workers.
